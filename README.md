# Docker-compose setup to run nextcloud for oberfeld

## Containers

This setup consist of the following containers:
- nextcloud: The container running the nextcloud app
- db: MariaDb container to store nextclouds data 
- elasticsearch: The container running the elasticsearch index for the fulltextsearch
- proxy: Ngin-X server to automatically route different domains/virtual host to the corresponding container ips
- letsencrypt-companion: companion for proxy to download certificates for https encryptions
- adminer: admin gui for the DB
- portainer: admin gui for the entire setup.

## Manual interaction when installing:

### (local only) set host names
To be able to access the different application you need to choose different domains for this, as 
the proxy redirect based on the hostname used to call the request.

On linux and mac, you may add those hosts in the `/etc/hosts` file, such as 
```
127.0.0.1   localhost
127.0.0.1   greenbox
127.0.0.1   portainer
127.0.0.1   adminer
```
### set vm.max_map_count
elasticsearch needs vm.max_map_count to be set to a min of 262144
see here [https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docker.html]

### .env File
create `.env` file with the following content (values need to be changed accordingly)
```ini
#if "true", will fetch certs from letsencrypt. Use "false" locally 
USE_LETSENCRYPT="false"
